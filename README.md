# transparent-window-unity
allows you to make your unity window transparent on build 

(note: this may look confusing but just copy and paste the script the rest is easy)
(note2: ui doesnt work for this i cant figure out why you will need to create your own)

how to set up:
1. create an empty game object and place the script on it
2. place the camera on the script in the inspector
3. make the camera background fully black with 0 alpha
4. go to edit->project settings->player->resolution and tick the Run In Background button(this doesnt have to be ticked but it will look alot better if it is)
5. build the project and it should be transparent
